## GNUCASH-ASX-FETCH

This is a command line utility to fetch and update
[ASX](https://asx.com.au) share prices to one or more
[GnuCash](https://www.gnucash.org/) XML files. It takes multiple
arguments: one of more GnuCash files, or directories. If a directory is
given then it updates all the GnuCash files in that directory. It can
not update any GnuCash files that are currently open so will generate an
error message for those files. A new price entry is added every time you
run it. Open the GnuCash price database editor for a file to view, edit,
or remove the new entries added.

For example, to update the share prices of all the ASX shares in all the
GnuCash files in the current directory type:

```
$ gnucash-asx-fetch .
```

:warning: This utility overwrites your GnuCash file[s] so be sure to save
copies at least the first time you try using it.

Note it only updates GnuCash XML files, not GnuCash sqlite files. It
silently skips GnuCash backup and log files.
This utility should work on any modern Linux platform and has been
developed against GnuCash v4.4.

### MOTIVATION

GnuCash uses the [Finance::Quote](https://github.com/finance-quote)
module to update share prices but I have found it fragile over the short
time I have been using GnuCash. E.g. At the time I created this utility,
ASX price fetches via [Finance::Quote](https://github.com/finance-quote)
have not been working at all for more than 3 months as per [this
bug](https://github.com/finance-quote/finance-quote/issues/166).

Fetching prices from [ASX](https://asx.com.au) is actually quite easy
and this utility uses a simple approach. By merely requiring the user to
not have the file open at the time he updates the prices, it can avoid
the awkward interface with
[Finance::Quote](https://github.com/finance-quote) and GnuCash
completely, and merely write directly to the XML file.

If you like this utility then you may be interested in [another
utility](https://github.com/bulletmark/gnucash-select) I created to
facilitate working with multiple GnuCash files.
